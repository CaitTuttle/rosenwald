        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p class="county-text"> *Please note that the New/Inclusive Rankings are not intended to be a complete analysis of school success. It is rather created to start conversations about how county rankings that use gross outcomes (i.e. test scores, graduation rates) are not an accurate measure of success, but rather a measure of affluence. A more comprehensive measurement is necessary. </p>

    <section id="methodology" class="section">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>We know these measures are outdated and racialized, so to identify some issues with these measures, we created a list of things we believed may be predictors of these outcomes. For example, poverty, food insecurity, race, and homelessness may be predictors of these outcomes. Using multiple linear regression, we tested to what extent these factors (we had a list of factors amounting to more than 30) can predict the outcomes we were looking at (the roadmap of needs rankings). We eliminated factors that had a p value over .05 and any factors that demonstrated multicollinearity, and ultimately found that our testing data (a list of thirty factors) could predict the given outcomes with 67.7%% accuracy and the trained data (a list of 13 factors) with 78% accuracy. This indicates that the measures of county success are actually measures of community affluence, not good measures of school success or effort. </p>

        <p>From The Rosenwald Fund: Review for the two year period 1944-1946, courtesy of Duke Archives 
            “ The chief activities of the Julius Rosenwald Fund were… (1) education of teachers, both Negro and white, for service in the rural schools of the South; (2) awarding of fellowships to Negroes and to white Southerners of special promise in their various fields of work and interest; (3) operation of a greatly expanded program aimed at the improvement of race relations throughout the county.”

            <h3> More about Russell School</h3>
            <p>Russell School was built in 1926 to serve as a school for local residents, but in 1945 it transformed from a school into an active community center. </p>
            <p>After 1945, Russell School hosted many <strong>events for families and community members.</strong>  Alum reported the following activities: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Marbles for the kids</li>
                <li>Fish frys</li>
                <li>The may pole</li>
                <li>Playing in the creek across the street</li>
                <li>Going “fishing.” This entails throwing a fishing line through the school window while adults stand on the other side and attach small prizes, such as candy, to the line.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One alum reported that their favorite subject was social studies. At this school, social studies involved reading the newspaper, and since they were donated materials, the newspapers were often a week old</p>
            <blockquote class="county-quote">“The only thing I remember was that this is where we went as a member of the church. When I was young, I just remember this is where we came to eat good food. I didn't know anything about it being a school until my mother started doing research.”</blockquote>

                    <p>“Today there is a singular group in Durham where a black man may get up in the morning from a mattress made by black men, in a house which a black man built out of lumber which black men cut and planed; he may put on a suit which he bought at a colored haberdashery and socks knit as a colored mill; he may cook victuals from a colored grocery on a stove which black men fashioned; he may earn his leaving working for colored men, be sick in a colored hospital, and buried from a colored church; and the Negro insurance society will pay his widow enough to keep his children in a colored school. This is surely progress.” -Excerpt from W.E.B. Du Bois’ The Upbuilding of Black Durham. The success of the Negroes and Their Value to a Tolerant and Helpful Southern City</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Caswell County, North Carolina, was established in 1777.</li>
                <li>The Caswell Training School was a school that operated from 1934 to 1969. According to the book “Their Highest Potential,” this school focuses on the importance of dedicated teachers and the principal who believed their jobs extended well beyond the classroom and to the community’s parents, who worked to support the school. According to Vanessa Walker (author of the book), the relationship between the school and the community was mutually dependent. 
                <ul>
                    <li>The parents sacrificed financially to meet the school's needs, and teachers and administrators put in extra time for professional development, specialized student assistance, and home visits. </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A new project has been implemented in Caswell County, where memories of educational roots are captured in six Rosenwald schools (Beulah, Blackwell, Dortmund, New Ephesus, Milton, and Yancyville). The point of this project is to connect education and the arts to retell and relive Caswell’s African American past and how they debuted in the passport of traditions, doctrines, core values, and cultural indifferences.</li>
