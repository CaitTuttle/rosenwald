            <h3><strong>Research Question:</strong> Can implementing Rosenwald Schools' holistic practices in North Carolina schools address structual inequities and improve student learning outcomes?
            </h3>
            <h3><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Current School rankings in North Carolina do not provive a comprehensive analysis of how structural inequities impact student learning.
            </h3>
            <h3><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> If school districts in North Carolina could draw on the holistic practices of Rosenwald Schools, structural inequities would be addressed, and student learning would improve

        <h3>Traditionally, <a href="https://www.ncforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Roadmap-of-Need-2023-Full.pdf" target="_blank">school rankings</a> are evaluated based on the outcomes of student achievement on yearly standardized tests.  The <a href="https://www.ncforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Roadmap-of-Need-2023-Full.pdf" target="_blank">Public School Forum of North Carolina</a> regularly publishes an annual ranking of  all 100 NC counties ordered from most successful to least successful.  </h3>
        <h3>However, these school rankings do not consider the presence or absence of structural inequities impacting student performance, and thus do not accurately reflect student achievement. </h3>
        <h3><strong>Students across the state of North Carolina face many challenges inside and outside of schools. Our team determined a list of factors impacting student achievement through producing a model which predicts outcome based on additional structural factors.<i> See this explained more in Methodology</i></strong></h3>

        <h3><strong>Education in Durham County: An Overview</strong></h3>
        <p class= "county-text">'Rosenwald schools,' as colloquially known, were public schools established for Black students across the southern United States during the first half of the twentieth century. Julius Rosenwald, a white philanthropist who made his fortune through Sears, Roebuck, & Co., partnered with leading Black educator Booker T Washington and Tuskegee University to design, create, and fund the construction of these state-of the-art community schools.  The Rosenwald Foundation offered partial financial investments to local communities, and area residents were charged with raising the remainder of necessary funding.</p>
        <p class= "county-text">In North Carolina, communities built more than 800 Rosenwald schools - more than any other state in the South [48].  These schools served as community hubs, fostering unity and empowerment during a period of stark racial segregation. These schools were staffed by highly trained Black and white educational professionals with specialized interests and expertise in various disciplines and served to beneficially impact and improve fraught race relations throughout the South.</p>
        <p class= "county-text">Rosenwald schools not only provided academic instruction, but also taught students a variety of vocational and technical skills, proffered social and political awareness, and emphasized the importance of community engagement.  Rosenwald Schools significantly improved attendance and literacy rates among Black students, laying a foundation for educational equity and social advancement in the region [1].</p>
        <p class= "county-text">Blueprints for each educational facility and accompanying structures (such as teacher cottages and industrial buildings) were drawn from a central cadre of designs by leading architects.  The school campus was to be centrally located within the community, constructed facing east to maximize the use of natural light, with enough meeting space to accommodate adults as well as children. The size of each school building was relative to the available financial resources of each community, with design plans available from one-room schoolhouses to seven-room schoolhouses.</p>

                                <h3><strong>Education in Durham County: An Overview</strong></h3>
                                <p>Durham County, named after the town of Durham, was founded in 1881 and is situated in north-central North Carolina [56]. As of 2020, it is the 6th most populous county in the state [75]. White male students gained the first educational opportunities in 1852 when a private school referred to simply as “Academy” opened [55]. It wasn’t until 1891, nearly 40 years later, that African Americans gained access to a publicly available educational opportunity with the opening of Whitted School [16]. </p>
                                <h3><strong>A Rosenwald School in Durham County: Russell School</strong></h3>
                                <p>Russell School, built in 1926, was one of 18 Rosenwald schools that were built in Durham county, and is the only remaining Rosenwald school building that still stands today [49]. The curriculum taught at the Russell School was comprehensive. One notable part of the curriculum was social studies. An alumnus, whose favorite subject was social studies, says that at the Russell School, “social studies looked like reading the newspaper and discussing current events.” Since many of the materials used at the Russell School were donated and/or secondhand, the newspapers students used were often weeks old. This stands as an example of the school's many victories over systemic inequities.</p>
                                <p>The Russell School building served as an educational facility for residents for 19 years, but in 1945, it transformed from a school into an active community center. After its conversion, Russell School hosted many events for families and community members. Activities remembered by alumni included marbles for the children, fish fries, the may pole, and playing in the creek across the street. One other beloved activity was going “fishing.” This entailed throwing a fishing line through the school window while adults stood on the other side and attached small prizes, such as candy, to the line. </p>

Born in 1863, Moore was Durham’s first Black physician and founded Lincoln Hospital, a critical healthcare institution for Black patients and a training hospital for doctors. He also secured Rosenwald funding and introduced the Jeanes Fund to Durham, further stimulating educational progress [72]. Dr. Moore contributed to the founding of Durham’s Black Wall Street, which inspired the rise of influential Black-owned businesses such as the historic NC Mutual Life Insurance Company and Mechanics and Farmers Bank [7].</p>

                                                    <p>Hayti (pronounced Hay-tie), from the 1880s to the 1940s, was the hub for commercial, economic, and social activity for Durham’s Black community [33]. With over 200 Black businesses, theaters, and a cultural scene that is known for its creation of the piedmont blues, Hayti was extremely successful and served as a self-sufficient enclave [33]. In the mid-twentieth century, the Hayti area was negatively impacted through urban renewal, which eliminated large portions of the neighborhood. The development of State Highway 147 through the center of Hayti also contributed to its decline [70]. Efforts like the Hayti Heritage Center now work to preserve the area’s cultural legacy and broader contributions to Durham’s history.

Dr. AM Moore and local entrepreneur, John Merrick, partnered together and established the library which has served as a valuable institution for showcasing African-American works in Durham [15]. Originally a Sunday School library, it evolved into a public community resource offering free books, hosting debates, home to the Negro Braille Magazine, and housing the esteemed Negro Collection [15]. These are some of the many testaments to the library’s role in promoting literacy and intellectual engagement among African Americans in Durham.</p>

In Durham, the Jeanes Fund sponsored influential Black teachers who provided academic guidance, imparted practical skills, and ultimately served as assistants to school board officials to lead and direct the development of Black education [79]. Supported by a national group of racially integrated Board of Trustees, including prominent figures like Booker T. Washington and Andrew Carnegie, the Jeanes Fund left a lasting impact on educational equality and community development in Durham and beyond [79].

        <div class="event-boxes-alt">
            <div class="event-box-alt">
        <p>A series of semi-structured interviews was conducted to gather thematic data on Rosenwald Schools. Each interview was designed to ensure that a diverse range of perspectives were captured from both rural and urban North Carolina counties. The interviews not only enhanced our understanding of Rosenwald schools and their impact but also provided rich narratives that support themes listed below.</p>
        <p>What follows are excerpts from our interview participants on four themes:  the quality and qualifications of the education professionals who staffed Rosenwald schools, various opportunities afforded to students and community members through the school itself, expectations for student achievement, and what it meant to participants to belong to these communities.</p>
        <p>Despite differences in location (eg., urban Durham county vs rural Caswell county) and setting (eg., one room vs seven room school buildings), alumni shared remarkable similarities in their school experiences.</p>

                <h3>Goal 1</h3>
                <p> School measurements will reflect student growth that comes from academic interventions and overall school health. It should not be possible to predict a school's ranking by community population alone.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event-box">
                <h3>Goal 2</h3>
                <p>If schools are failing because students, families, and teachers don't have their needs met, the state will be obliged to provide them with what they need to be successful.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event-box">
                <h3>Goal 3</h3>
                <p>Rosenwald schools will be used as a shining example of what schools can look like when they are connected to the students they are serving.</p>

    <div class="event-box">
        <h3>Limitation 1</h3>
        <p>Our results presume amelioration of complex social, political, and cultural issues, such as poverty and wages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="event-box">
        <h3>Limitation 2</h3>
        <p>Our selection of variables was determined by a limited survey of the literature on factors of social impact.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="event-box">
        <h3>Limitation 3</h3>
        <p>Our study did not include the limitations or allocations of NC’s educational budget.</p>
